## Rate Limit Algorithms

In this section, we will explore different rate limiting algorithms that can be implemented in the application. Each algorithm has its own advantages and use cases.


### Token Bucket Algorithm
The Token Bucket algorithm allows a certain number of tokens to be generated at a fixed rate. Each request consumes a token, and if no tokens are available, the request is denied. This algorithm is suitable for scenarios where bursts of traffic are expected.

### Leaky Bucket Algorithm
The Leaky Bucket algorithm processes requests at a constant rate, regardless of the incoming request rate. Excess requests are queued and processed one at a time. This algorithm is ideal for smoothing out traffic spikes and ensuring a steady flow of requests.

### Sliding Window Algorithm
The Sliding Window algorithm divides time into fixed-size windows and counts the number of requests in each window. If the number of requests exceeds the limit in any window, further requests are denied until the next window. This algorithm is effective for limiting requests over a specific time period.
